# PlayCam-Cricket-Shot-Prediction-Model
A real-time deep learning project to classify cricket shots (Cover, Pull, Straight, Sweep) using webcam video and pose estimation with MediaPipe + LSTM.
This project preprocesses cricket shot videos, extracts body/hand/face landmarks from each frame, trains an LSTM model, and then predicts shot types in real-time using webcam input. It is also being integrated into a game control system for simulated batting based on predicted shots.

## Features
✅ Pose-based shot classification using MediaPipe Holistic (pose, hands, face)
✅ LSTM deep learning model for temporal pattern recognition
✅ 4-class classification: **Cover, Pull, Straight, Sweep**
✅ Webcam-based real-time prediction with trigger
✅ Confidence thresholding to avoid false detection
**Game integration in progress** — predicted shots will trigger keyboard actions as I already have gone through vgamepad and it won't work of Low-Level Inputs

## How It Works

1. **Video Input**: One short .mp4 for each shot class (1080x1920p, 30fps),compilation of shots of same type
2. **Keypoint Extraction**: Using MediaPipe Holistic → extracts 1662 keypoints per frame
3. **Sequence Creation**: Groups frames into overlapping sequences of shape (30, 1662) with sliding window
4. **Model Training**: LSTM model learns from these sequences
5. **Prediction**: Real-time webcam captures 30-frame sequence, predicts shot
6. **(In Progress)**: Triggers shot action in-game via keyboard(pyautogui module)

## Getting Started

### Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Prepare Dataset

Organize your videos like this:

```
dataset/
├── Cover/
│   └── Cover.mp4
├── Pull/
│   └── Pull.mp4
├── Straight/
│   └── Straight.mp4
└── Sweep/
    └── Sweep.mp4
```

Each .mp4 should contain n repetitions of that shot.

### Extract Keypoints

```bash
python Extraction.py
```

This creates `MP_Data/` with .npy sequences.

### 🧠 Train the Model

```bash
python train_model.py
```

The best model is saved as `best_model.h5`

### Run Realtime Prediction

```bash
python predict_realtime.py
```

Press `s` to start detection. Model waits for 30 frames(can be changed), then captures and predicts.

##  Game Integration (Work in Progress)

Currently, a keyboard interface is being implemented:

* Trigger with `ALT + Z`
* Predict a shot from pose
* Simulate keyboard (e.g., press 'A' for straight drive)

Stay tuned for updates on game compatibility!

## Model Details

* LSTM + LSTM + Dense + Dropout + Softmax
* Input shape: (30, 1662)
* Output: 4-shot softmax class
* Uses `categorical_crossentropy` with `LabelBinarizer`

## 📦 Dependencies

* `mediapipe`
* `opencv-python`
* `tensorflow`
* `numpy`
* `scikit-learn`

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python tensorflow numpy scikit-learn
```
